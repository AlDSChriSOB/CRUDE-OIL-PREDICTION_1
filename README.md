# CRUDE-OIL-PREDICTION_1
MICROSOFT EXCEL PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS FOR CRUDE OIL PROJECT
Predicting US Crude Oil Imports with Excel (Time Series Analysis)
This project explores the use of Excel for predictive analysis, focusing on forecasting US crude oil imports for the next month.

Background:

The United States is a major consumer of imported oil, relying heavily on foreign sources to meet its energy needs. In 2019, daily imports averaged around 7.9 million barrels, primarily from the Americas and the Middle East.

Project Goal:

This project aims to predict crude oil imports into the USA for the next month using time series analysis techniques within an Excel environment. Time series analysis is a statistical method specifically designed for forecasting future values based on historical data trends and patterns.

Data Description:

The analysis utilizes a dataset containing monthly crude oil import volumes (in thousand barrels) for the US, with each record including the date (month and year).

Forecasting Technique:

This project employs a popular time series forecasting model known as Moving Average (MA) forecasting. The MA model calculates the average import volume over a specific period (e.g., past 3 months) and uses this average as the forecast for the next month.

Excel Analysis:

Excel's data analysis tools will be leveraged to:

Visualize historical crude oil import data using time series charts.
Calculate and display various moving averages (e.g., 3-month, 6-month) alongside the actual import data.
Present the forecasted import volume for the next month based on the chosen moving average model.
Benefits:

This project provides a user-friendly approach for:

Gaining insights into historical import trends and seasonality patterns.
Utilizing a data-driven approach for short-term forecasting of US crude oil imports.
Making informed decisions regarding energy consumption and potential import fluctuations.
